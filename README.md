# CTFdScraper

added verify=false for tls issue 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to run this properly, you need a `python2` or `python3` environment installed. For  a certain circumstance, `termux` user need to install several packages before installing [lxml](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3793).

```bash
# Termux-only (lxml)
$ pkg install clang libxml2 libxslt
$ pip install cython
```

### Installation

After fulfilling the prerequisites, you can directly clone this repository or download the source from our [releases](https://github.com/hanasuru/CTFdScraper/releases).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hanasuru/CTFdScraper
```

After that, go install its dependencies by using `pip`.

```bash
$ cd CTFdScraper/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

For instances, you can check helper section by passing `-h` or `--help`.

```bash
$ python ctfd.py --help
usage: ctfd.py [-h] [--data data] [--proxy proxy] [--path path]
               [--worker worker] [--scheme scheme] [--enable-cloud]
               [--override] [--no-download] [--export]
               [user] [passwd] [url]

Simple CTFd-based scraper for challenges gathering

positional arguments:
  user             Username/email
  passwd           Password
  url              CTFd platform url

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --data data      Populate from challs.json
  --proxy proxy    Request behind proxy server
  --path path      Target directory, default: CTF
  --worker worker  Number of threads, default: 10
  --scheme scheme  URL scheme, default: https
  --enable-cloud   Permit file download from a cloud drive, default=False
  --override       Override existed chall file
  --no-download    Don't download chall file
  --export         Export challenges directory as zip, default=False
                                                      
```
### Collect challenges by credentials

By default, you need to define `username`, `password`, and `CTFd` url respectively (use HTTPS by default).  

```bash
$ python ctfd.py user passwd https://some-domain
```

### Enable Cloud-files download

By default, this option are disabled due to file size issues where user accidentally spend most of internet quotas from downloading a large file. Otherwise, you can enable this opting by passing `--enable-cloud` argument

```bash
$ python ctfd.py user passwd https://some-domain --enable-cloud
``` 

Currently, only `Google-drive` and `Dropbox` that are supported.

As a note, the review that shows size output may be wrong (false positive) due to the usage of request.get(url, stream=True) in order to get the `Content-Length` header  

### Override existed challenges file

During CTF competition, the organizer may update the current binary/file. Unfortunately, by default `CTFdScraper` couldn't override the existed challenges file. If you insist to modify the current binary/file, you need to pass `--override` argument

```bash
$ python ctfd.py user passwd https://some-domain --override
```

### Collect challenges by existed `challs.json`

Alternatively, you can also populate only the challenges from an existed `challs.json`. Additionally, you can also combine with `--enable-cloud` & `--override` to download files from a cloud drive. Furthermore, check the [examples](./examples/CTF/Arkavidia/challs.json).

```bash
# Populate challenges only from existed data
$ python ctfd.py --data challs.json

# Populate challenges alongwith files
$ python ctfd.py user passwd https://some-domain --data chall.json

# Populate challenges alongwith interal file (if public) and external file
$ python ctfd.py --data chall.json --enable-cloud --override
```

### Enable request behind proxy

To be able to conduct a requests behind proxy you need to pass `--proxy proxy-server` argument or manually add `export http_proxy="http://host:port"`.

```bash
$ python ctfd.py user passwd https://some-domain --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080

# or set up an environtment variable
$ export http_proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
$ export https_proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

### Wrap up the CTFd folder into a Zip file 

For archiving purpose, you can save the `CTFd` folder as a Zip file by passing the `--export` argument

```bash
$ python ctfd.py user passwd https://some-domain --export
```

Lastly, the collected challenge will be saved to `CTF/${ctf_name}`
directory. You can customize the path by passing `--path pathname`argument.
